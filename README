University of Hawaii

Lab 3

Included in this directory are files for Lab 3:

*  Data files:  file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt
*  Example files:  server.c, client.c, and pipe.c

You will write a server program named "server367.c".
Each student will have a distinct port number for
their server.  See the project's Assignment in
laulima for your port number.  You will also have
a client program named "client367.c".
You should have a makefile(s) for your programs
so that the executable for the server is "server367"
and the executable for the client is "client367".

Submit your project by having your program files 
(source code and executables) 
in this directory.  This directory should also
have your makefiles, the data files (file1.txt,
file2.txt, and file3.txt), and a README file,
which replaces this README file. The new README
file should include your name, date, an explanation
of what your programs do, and an explanation
of how to compile your programs.

Your directory should be tar'd
and gzipped, and uploaded into laulima.
